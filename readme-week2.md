## What are the benefits of using a RESTful API
Restful api makes it very easy to set up API endpoints. With http methods like GET or PUT, it's easy to set up endpoints with CRUD functionalities.
Rest lets you have a stateless database that makes it easily expandable with distributed database systems.

## What is JSON, and why does JSON fit so well with REST?
JSON is a text based format to send and recieve data. The structure of JSON fits well with Rest cause you're able to send and recieve lists of data together and you can costumize what data you want to send or recieve for ressources.

## How you have designed simple CRUD endpoints using spring boot and DTOs to separate api from data  -> Focus on your use of DTO's
I've made 2 controller classes, for Cars and Members, which are annotated with the @Controller annotation. I label every endpoint in my controller class with an HTTP method that descripes what CRUD operation it's handling. In the endpoints I call on the Service class for the respective entities which will call the respective Repository methods that handle the calls to the database. 

I use DTOs is to have a "response" and a "request" DTO for each entity to customize the exact data that's being sent to and from my database. 
The request DTO is the data that I send to my backend, for example when I wanna make a new data entry for my car table. The DTO doesn't include the Id attribute, since that will be created in the database when it recieves the request.
The response DTO is what we'll recieve back from the database. In this program, we include a boolean variable that determines whether information such as user metadata or data about car deals should be visible.

## What is the advantage of using using DTOs to separate api from data structure when designing rest endpoints
By using DTOs you can customize what data you want to send and recieve from the database. For example, users should not have access to the best discount a car has had, but the admin should be able to see this. 
On the other end, we can also choose to not send specific data. For example the CarRequest DTO doesn't include an ID since it's the job of the database to generate and assign the Car an ID.

## Explain shortly the concept mocking in relation to software testing
Mocking is used to "mock" a database so that a testing enviroment will think that it's using a real database without having to implement one, unlike H2 which uses the computers internal memory to initiate a test database.

## How did you mock database access in your tests, using an in-memory database and/or mockito â†’ Refer to your code
I used H2 and therefore have not mocked my database due to time constraints from my part.

## Explain the concept Build Server and the role Github Actions play here
A build server is an external server that will build and test the software before it get's deployed. The build server will give a "go" or "no go" depending on if the software was able to build without any errors or failed tests. 
Github actions includes a build server, which means that you can build, test and deploy the software in the same place. Github actions lets you run multiple workflows for your software and gives  a very easy visual overview of the workflows.

## Explain maven, relevant parts in maven, and how maven is used in our CI setup. Explain where maven is used by your GitHub Actions Script(s)
Maven let's us run our programe without the use of an IDE. This let's us run workflows on any server that uses a linux terminal. 
Maven is used in our workflow, descriped in our YAML file. In our file it's descriped that we'll run mvn commands in a linux container to build our programe.
